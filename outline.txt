Detailed Application Outline: Open Referral UK Service Finder
This document provides a comprehensive outline for a web application that allows users to find and manage community services based on the Open Referral UK (ORUK) standard. It includes a FastAPI backend, a Bootstrap frontend, claimant management with location-based filtering, and interactive mapping.
1. Overall Approach & Architecture
We will build a full-stack application with a decoupled frontend and backend.
Backend (FastAPI): A Python-based API will handle all business logic, data processing, and database interactions. It will expose RESTful endpoints for the frontend to consume.
Frontend (Bootstrap & JavaScript): A responsive user interface built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the Bootstrap framework for styling and layout. This will communicate with the backend via HTTP requests.
Database (PostGIS/SQLite with SpatiaLite): A SQL database will store the application data. Using a spatially-enabled database like PostgreSQL with PostGIS is crucial for handling GeoJSON data and performing efficient spatial queries.
Mapping (Leaflet.js): A lightweight and powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive maps to visualize service locations and claimant travel areas.
2. User Stories
Here are some user stories to guide development, based on potential user roles.
As a Case Worker, I want to:
US1: View a list of all available services so that I can see what is on offer.
US2: Filter services by category, location, and cost, so that I can find suitable options for my claimants.
US3: View service locations on a map to understand their geographical distribution.
US4: Add new claimants to the system, including their name and home location (as a latitude/longitude pair).
US5: Define a travel extent for a claimant (e.g., a 5-mile radius from their home) to see what services are accessible to them.
US6: See a claimant's travel area visualized on the map, along with all the services that fall within that area.
As an Administrator, I want to:
US7: Add new services to the directory, ensuring all required Open Referral UK fields are completed.
US8: Edit or update existing service information to keep the directory accurate.
US9: Remove services that are no longer available.
US10: View and manage the list of all claimants in the system.
As a Developer/DevOps Engineer, I want to:
DEV1: Have a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests for the backend API to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
DEV2: Have a Dockerfile for the backend application and a docker-compose.yml file to easily set up the entire application stack (backend, database) for local development and testing.
DEV3: Have a simple build script that packages the frontend and backend assets for deployment.
DEV4: Have a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that automatically runs tests on every push or pull request to the main branch.
3. Project Structure
This structure accommodates both the frontend and backend components.

4. Data Models & Schemas
We will expand on the previous Service model and add one for Claimant.
schemas.py (Pydantic):
Service Schema: Based on the ORUK standard.
Claimant Schema:
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional, Dict

class Claimant(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    home_latitude: float
    home_longitude: float
    travel_extent_geojson: Optional[Dict] = None # To store GeoJSON polygon/circle

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True


models.py (SQLAlchemy):
Service Model: A table to store service data. Will include a Geometry field for the service's location.
Claimant Model: A table for claimants. The travel_extent_geojson will be stored in a Geometry type field provided by GeoAlchemy2.
5. Backend API Endpoints (main.py)
Services:
POST /services/: Create a service.
GET /services/: Get a list of services. Will support query parameters for filtering (e.g., /services/?category=Health).
GET /services/{service_id}: Get a single service.
Claimants:
POST /claimants/: Create a claimant. The request will include the claimant's name and home location as a latitude/longitude pair. The backend will generate the travel_extent_geojson based on a default radius.
GET /claimants/: Get a list of all claimants.
GET /claimants/{claimant_id}: Get a single claimant.
Spatial Queries:
GET /services/within/: An endpoint that accepts a claimant's ID and returns all services that are geographically within that claimant's travel_extent_geojson.
6. Frontend Components (index.html & app.js)
Main Layout: A two-column layout using Bootstrap's grid system.
Filtering Controls: A form with dropdowns, text inputs, and sliders to filter services.
Results List: A dynamically updated list of cards for services.
Map Display:
Leaflet map showing service locations as markers.
When a claimant is selected, their travel_extent_geojson will be drawn as a layer on the map.
JavaScript Logic (app.js):
Fetch data from the FastAPI backend.
Dynamically generate HTML for results.
Update the map with markers and layers.
Handle user interactions to trigger API calls and UI updates.
